				~Welcome to DS64!~
A few quick notes:
	-Press B to rest at a bonfire, or to light the fire if it is unlit. 
	-While resting at a bonfire, your health will be restored.
	-If you die, you will respawn in front of the last bonfire at which you rested.
	-Keep an eye out for shortcuts you can open up; once activated, they will remain active,
	allowing you to reuse existing bonfires and avoid having to run through the area again.

This is my first real romhack, and was made possible by the SM64 Decomp Project.

I'd like to give a huge shout out to all of the amazing members of the SM64 Decomp Community
who suffered through my endless questioning. Without you guys, I would never have made it this far.

Have fun! Oh, and of course, shout outs to SimpleFlips.
